Find Closest Value In BST
You are given a BST data structure consisting of BST nodes. You are also given a target integer value.
Each BST node has an integer value stored in a property called "value" and two children nodes stored in properties called "left" and "right" respectively.
A node is said to be a BST node if and only if it satisfies the BST properties:
1) its value is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left;
2) its value is less than or equal to the values of every node to its right;
3) both of its children nodes are either BST nodes themselves or None (null) values.



Write a function that finds the closest value to that target value contained in the BST.
Assume that there will only be one closest value.â€‹
Example of input:
       10
       / \
      /   \
     /     \
    5      15
   / \     / \
  2   5   3  22
 / \
1  14,
Target number =12

Expected output: 13

# Recursive solution.
# Average case:
# time O(log(n)); space O(log(n)).
# Worst (when goes only to one direction, (e.g. has left nodes only)):
#  O(n), (O(n)); Where n - number of nodes.
# Space in this case will be occupied in memory by call stack.

    # we set closest to float("inf")

        # we got to last leaf. This is base condidion.
        return closest

        # target - closest - how far is target from previous closest value?
        # target - tree.value - how far is current value is far from target?
        # if current value is closer than previous closest, then we need to
        # update closest.
        closest = tree.value
    if target < tree.value:

        # in order to find smaller value
